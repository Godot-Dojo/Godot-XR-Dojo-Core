The Core Repository is the main developement repository regarding xr addons made by the Godot Dojo Group for the Godot Engine.

###
How To:
---------
check out the repository and the branch that you are going to work on.
once you have made a change to the branch you are working on, commit the change to the branch
this means if you are working in the branch "weapons", commit there and not to main!
###
The next step:
---------
You are to be expected to make the same change/commit to the respective repository.
This means if you changed something here in the branch "weapons", commit the same change to the "Godot-XR-Weapons" Repository.
To be precise to the Dev Branch of Godot-XR-Weapons

This is the way, to ensure that the current working addons are not loosing their functionality
once the changes/commits made are save to merge, they will be merged into the main of the respective repository.
